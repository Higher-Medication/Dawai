Our application is designed to make it easier to remember medication and take the required pills on time. It sends notifications and alarms the user on time to take medecine, and tracks his performance along the way. Also you can add symptoms you face in any time to be able to review them in case you had to explain anything to a doctor. It makes some people's lifes easier especially with the easy to use interface.

Maram for her hard work and commitment, Majd with his ideas and designing skills, Khalil for his Good background in programming language and Mohammad also for his background in Java Android development. This combination in one team will result in a great teamwork and great efforts. 


### Conflict Plan 
It is common to have disagreements among team members, But it is important to know how to deal with it, by discussing the problem, analyzing it, understanding the different points of view, knowing what is right, and knowing what is wrong. if one person is taking over the project and not letting the other members contribute, the team leader will discuss the problem with this person individually, after which the problem will be discussed with the team through a meeting. If some members do not participate, their negligence at work will be declared, and they will be given an additional opportunity, in the event that nothing changes, they will be required to change them to another person.


### Communication Plan
It is important for all members to be at the exact same place in understanding. Therefore, we should work flexibly with the rest of the team members and not hesitate to ask for help in case you encounter any challenge in the project. As a team, we will work on a zoom meeting everyday to keep track of the project progress , manage the tasks and help each other to cover the whole project. Also we will keep in touch on slack.


### Work Plan
Team skills can be exploited by distributing the appropriate task to each person in proportion to their skill. When team members use their abilities and strengths in the right place, they will be creative and successful.  Each person on the team will demonstrate their strengths and prove that they are capable of doing this part of the project, after that the team leader will define the appropriate task for each person. 


### Git Process
The team leader creates a repository for the project and handles every Pull Request from the team members during the work progress to make sure that there are no conflicts before merging to the main branch.
